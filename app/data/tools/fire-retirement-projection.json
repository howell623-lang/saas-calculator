By saving 50% or more of your income, you can compress 40 years of saving into 10-15 years.\n\n**The equation is simple:**\n*   Higher Savings Rate = Faster Freedom\n*   Lower Expenses = Lower FI Number\n\nIf you save 0% of your income, you can never retire. If you save 100% of your income (living for free), you can retire today."

At a 4% withdrawal rate ($1.25M x 0.04), your portfolio generates the $50,000 you need. \n\n*Note: This assumes your portfolio grows at ~7% and inflation is ~3%, leaving you with a 4% 'safe' withdrawal.*"

Be careful assuming higher returns.\n3.  **Withdrawal Rate:** Conservative investors prefer a 3.5% or 3% withdrawal rate to be safe, which requires a larger portfolio (33x expenses)."
