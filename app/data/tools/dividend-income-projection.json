      "q": "What is Dividend Growth Investing?",
      "a": "It involves buying shares of companies that not only pay dividends but consistently increase them every year (like 'Dividend Aristocrats'). Over time, this acts as an inflation hedge and increases your 'Yield on Cost'."

    {
      "q": "What is DRIP?",
      "a": "A Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) automatically uses your cash dividends to buy more shares of the same stock. This compounds your growth, as your new shares generate their own dividends."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is Yield on Cost?",
      "a": "This is your current dividend income divided by your *original* purchase price. If you bought Coca-Cola in 1990, your yield on cost today might be 50%+, even if the stock's current yield is only 3%."

      "q": "How are dividends taxed?",
      "a": "In the US, 'Qualified Dividends' are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate (0%, 15%, or 20%). 'Non-qualified' dividends (like from REITs) are taxed at your regular income tax rate."

      "body": "Dividend investing is not a get-rich-quick scheme; it is a get-rich-for-sure scheme. By reinvesting dividends, you harness the dual engines of wealth: **Capital Appreciation** (stock price goes up) and **Dividend Growth** (payouts go up).\n\nImagine you own 1,000 shares paying $1/share. You get $1,000. You use that to buy 20 more shares. Next year, the company raises the dividend to $1.10. Now you have 1,020 shares paying $1.10. Your income jumps to $1,122. Repeat this for 20 years, and the curve goes vertical."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Yield vs. Growth",
      "body": "There are two main strategies:\n1.  **High Yield:** Buying stocks paying 4-8% today (e.g., Verizon, REITs). Good for current income, but usually low growth.\n2.  **High Growth:** Buying stocks paying 1-2% today but growing the payout by 10-15% annually (e.g., Visa, Microsoft). Better for long-term total return.\n\nThis calculator lets you simulate both. Try inputting a high yield with low growth, then a low yield with high growth, and see which wins over 20 years."
