  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How do I calculate the concrete needed for a slab?",
      "answer": "To calculate the concrete needed, multiply the length by the width by the thickness. Ensure all dimensions are in consistent units (e.g., feet for length/width, then convert inches to feet for thickness) to get cubic feet, then divide by 27 to convert to cubic yards. Always add a waste factor (typically 5-10%) to account for spillage and uneven subgrades."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a typical thickness for a concrete slab?",
      "answer": "Standard residential slabs for patios, walkways, or light-traffic driveways are typically 4 inches thick. For heavier loads like RV pads, garage floors, or foundations, 5-6 inches might be preferred to support the extra weight."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many 80lb bags of concrete are in a cubic yard?",
      "answer": "There are approximately 40-45 bags of 80lb concrete mix in one cubic yard. Our calculator uses an average of 0.67 cubic feet per 80lb bag for its estimate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to add a waste factor?",
      "answer": "Yes, it is highly recommended to include a waste factor (typically 5-10%) in your concrete calculations. This ensures you have enough material to cover for potential spillage, slight variations in subgrade, or miscalculations, preventing costly delays."
