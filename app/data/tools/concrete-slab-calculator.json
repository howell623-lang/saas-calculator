  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "How do I calculate the concrete needed for a slab?",
      "a": "To calculate the concrete needed, multiply the length by the width by the thickness. Ensure all dimensions are in consistent units (e.g., feet for length/width, then convert inches to feet for thickness) to get cubic feet, then divide by 27 to convert to cubic yards. Always add a waste factor (typically 5-10%) to account for spillage and uneven subgrades."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is a typical thickness for a concrete slab?",
      "a": "Standard residential slabs for patios, walkways, or light-traffic driveways are typically 4 inches thick. For heavier loads like RV pads, garage floors, or foundations, 5-6 inches might be preferred to support the extra weight."
    },
    {
      "q": "How many 80lb bags of concrete are in a cubic yard?",
      "a": "There are approximately 40-45 bags of 80lb concrete mix in one cubic yard. Our calculator uses an average of 0.67 cubic feet per 80lb bag for its estimate."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do I need to add a waste factor?",
      "a": "Yes, it is highly recommended to include a waste factor (typically 5-10%) in your concrete calculations. This ensures you have enough material to cover for potential spillage, slight variations in subgrade, or miscalculations, preventing costly delays."

      "heading": "Understanding Concrete Volumes",
      "body": "Concrete is volume-based, not weight-based, when ordered from a ready-mix truck. The standard unit of measurement is the **Cubic Yard** (often just called a \"yard\"). \n\nOne cubic yard is a volume of 3 feet x 3 feet x 3 feet, or 27 cubic feet. \n\n**Visualizing a Yard:** Imagine a cube that is 3 feet on all sides. That block of solid concrete weighs approximately 4,000 lbs (2 tons). This is why precise calculation is crucial; ordering 1 yard too much is a disposal nightmare, and ordering 1 yard too little is a disaster for your project finish."

      "heading": "Bagged Concrete vs. Ready-Mix Truck",
      "body": "When should you mix it yourself versus calling a truck? \n\n*   **Bagged Concrete:** Best for projects requiring less than 1 cubic yard (approx. 45 bags of 80lbs). Examples: Letterbox post, small AC pad, walkway repair.\n*   **Ready-Mix Truck:** Essential for larger projects. Trucks typically have a minimum order (often 3-4 yards) or charge a \"short load fee.\" \n\n**Cost Tip:** If you need 2+ yards, the truck is often cheaper than buying hundreds of bags, not to mention the back-breaking labor of mixing."

    {
      "heading": "Site Preparation: The Hidden Variable",
      "body": "The calculator assumes a perfectly flat subgrade, but reality is rarely perfect. \n\n1.  **Dips and Valleys:** If your ground has divots, you will need more concrete to fill them.\n2.  **Form Bowing:** Wooden forms often bow out slightly under the weight of wet concrete, increasing the volume needed.\n\nThis is why we default to a **5% Waste Factor**. For beginner DIYers digging irregular holes, we recommend increasing this to **10%**."
