    {
      "q": "What is BMI?",
      "a": "Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple screening tool that estimates your body fat based on your height and weight. It is widely used by healthcare professionals to assess whether an individual has a healthy body weight for a person of their height."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is BMI accurate for everyone?",
      "a": "While BMI is a useful screening tool for the general population, it has limitations. It does not distinguish between muscle mass and fat mass. Therefore, athletes with high muscle mass might be classified as 'overweight' despite having low body fat. Conversely, elderly individuals might have a 'normal' BMI but excess body fat."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is a healthy BMI range?",
      "a": "For most adults, a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered healthy. A BMI below 18.5 suggests you may be underweight, while a BMI between 25 and 29.9 indicates overweight. A BMI of 30 or higher falls into the obesity category."
    },
    {
      "q": "How often should I check my BMI?",
      "a": "Checking your BMI once a month is generally sufficient for tracking long-term trends. Weight can fluctuate daily due to hydration and other factors, so frequent checking might not provide a clear picture."

      "heading": "Understanding Body Mass Index (BMI)",
      "body": "Body Mass Index (BMI) is one of the most widely used metrics for assessing health in relation to weight. Developed in the 19th century by Adolphe Quetelet, it offers a quick way to categorize weight relative to height. While it is not a direct measure of body fat, it correlates moderately well with more direct measures like underwater weighing and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). For the vast majority of the population, BMI serves as a reliable red flag for potential health issues associated with being underweight, overweight, or obese."
    },
    {
      "heading": "How the Calculation Works",
      "body": "The formula for BMI is straightforward: weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m²). For example, if you weigh 70kg and are 1.75m tall, your BMI is 70 / (1.75 * 1.75) = 22.86. Our calculator handles these conversions for you automatically. It also calculates your 'Ideal Weight Range' by reversing the formula to find the weight boundaries that would place you between BMI 18.5 and 24.9."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Limitations and Context",
      "body": "It is crucial to interpret your BMI score in context. Because BMI calculates 'mass' rather than 'fat', it can be misleading for certain groups. Bodybuilders, pregnant women, and the elderly may get results that don't accurately reflect their health status. Always consider BMI alongside other metrics like waist circumference, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. If your BMI falls outside the 'Normal' range, consider it a prompt to consult with a healthcare provider rather than a definitive diagnosis."
