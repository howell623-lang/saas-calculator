    {
      "q": "What is the official formula for BMI?",
      "a": "The Body Mass Index is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by the square of your height in meters (kg/m²). If you use pounds and inches, the formula is: [weight (lb) / height (in)²] × 703."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why does my doctor care about BMI?",
      "a": "While imperfect, BMI is a strong predictor of future health risks. A high BMI correlates with increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones, breathing problems, and certain cancers."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is a BMI of 25 bad?",
      "a": "A BMI of 25.0 sits exactly on the border between 'Normal' and 'Overweight'. It is a signal to monitor your lifestyle habits, but it doesn't automatically mean you are unhealthy, especially if you have a muscular build."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is the healthy range 18.5 to 24.9?",
      "a": "This range was established by the World Health Organization (WHO) based on epidemiological data showing lowest mortality rates for individuals within these bounds."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does this tool work for children?",
      "a": "No. For children and teens (ages 2-19), BMI is age-and-gender-specific (known as BMI-for-age percentiles). This calculator uses adult metrics."

      "body": "Body Mass Index (BMI) is a foundational metric in modern medicine, acting as a primary screening tool for weight-related health risks. First introduced in the 1830s by Belgian statistician Adolphe Quetelet, it has stood the test of time due to its simplicity and strong correlation with body fat percentage across large populations. While it is not a diagnostic tool—it cannot diagnose body fatness or the health of an individual—it serves as a crucial 'vital sign' that prompts further assessment."

    {
      "heading": "The Mathematics of BMI",
      "body": "The calculation is elegant in its simplicity. It models the body as a cylinder, assuming that weight should increase proportionally to the square of height. \n\n**The Metric Formula:**\nBMI = Weight (kg) / Height (m)²\n\n**The Imperial Formula:**\nBMI = (Weight (lbs) / Height (in)²) × 703\n\nFor example, a person who is 1.75 meters tall and weighs 80 kg would calculate their BMI as follows: 1.75 squared is 3.0625. Then, 80 divided by 3.0625 equals 26.1, placing them in the 'Overweight' category."

      "heading": "Interpreting Your Results: The WHO Classifications",
      "body": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has established international standards for BMI categories to ensure consistency in health reporting:\n\n*   **Underweight (< 18.5):** May indicate malnutrition, an eating disorder, or other health issues. Risks include osteoporosis and weakened immune function.\n*   **Normal Weight (18.5 – 24.9):** Associated with the lowest statistical risk of weight-related chronic disease.\n*   **Overweight (25.0 – 29.9):** A 'yellow flag' zone. Modest weight loss here can prevent the onset of later conditions.\n*   **Obesity Class I (30.0 – 34.9):** Clear correlation with elevated blood pressure and cholesterol.\n*   **Obesity Class II (35.0 – 39.9):** High risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n*   **Obesity Class III (≥ 40.0):** Often referred to as 'severe' or 'morbid' obesity, warranting immediate medical intervention."

      "heading": "The 'Muscle Mass' Exception",
      "body": "The most common criticism of BMI is its inability to distinguish between lean muscle tissue and adipose tissue (fat). Muscle is denser than fat. Therefore, elite athletes, bodybuilders, and military personnel often register as 'Overweight' or even 'Obese' despite having low body fat percentages and excellent metabolic health. \n\n**Rule of Thumb:** If you are an athlete, use BMI as a secondary data point. Primary metrics should include Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR) and Body Fat Percentage measurements."

    {
      "heading": "Health Risks Associated with High BMI",
      "body": "Decades of research, including the famous Framingham Heart Study, have linked elevated BMI to specific chronic conditions. These include:\n\n1.  **Cardiovascular Disease:** High weight increases the workload on the heart.\n2.  **Type 2 Diabetes:** Excess fat tissue makes cells more resistant to insulin.\n3.  **Joint Issues:** Every pound of excess weight exerts roughly 4 pounds of extra pressure on the knees.\n4.  **Sleep Apnea:** Fat deposits around the neck can obstruct breathing during sleep."

      "heading": "Real World Example: The Linebacker Paradox",
      "body": "To understand BMI's limitations, consider a professional Linebacker:\n\n*   **Height:** 6'3\" (1.9m)\n*   **Weight:** 245 lbs (111kg)\n*   **BMI Score:** 30.7 (**Obese Class I**)\n\nDespite the 'Obese' label, this athlete likely has 12-15% body fat and excellent metabolic health. This illustrates why BMI is a **population-level tool**, not an individual diagnosis. If you have significant muscle mass, do not let a high BMI score discourage you. Focus on body composition metrics instead."
