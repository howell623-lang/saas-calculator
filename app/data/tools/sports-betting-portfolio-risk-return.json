    {
      "q": "What is Risk-Adjusted Return in sports betting?",
      "a": "Risk-adjusted return measures how much return an investment (or betting strategy) generates for each unit of risk taken. Unlike simple profit/loss, it considers the volatility or swings in your bankroll, offering a more complete picture of your strategy's efficiency."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the Sharpe Ratio and why is it used here?",
      "a": "The Sharpe Ratio is a widely used financial metric that measures the excess return (return above the risk-free rate) per unit of total risk (standard deviation). In sports betting, it helps you understand if the returns generated by your strategy are sufficient compensation for the level of risk you're undertaking. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a more efficient strategy."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I interpret the Sharpe Ratio for my betting strategy?",
      "a": "Generally, a Sharpe Ratio above 1 is considered good, above 2 very good, and above 3 excellent. For sports betting, any positive Sharpe Ratio indicates that your strategy is generating returns in excess of the risk-free rate for the risk taken. Comparing Sharpe Ratios of different strategies can reveal which one is more efficient at generating returns for a given level of risk."
    },
    {
      "q": "What inputs do I need to use this calculator?",
      "a": "You'll need your total net profit/loss over a specific period, your initial bankroll, the number of periods (e.g., days, weeks) represented in your data, the standard deviation of your periodic returns (as a percentage), the annual risk-free rate (e.g., from a savings account or short-term government bonds), and an annualization factor (e.g., 252 for daily data, 52 for weekly, 12 for monthly)."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I calculate the 'Standard Deviation of Periodic Returns'?",
      "a": "This is the most crucial input for volatility. You'll need historical data of your bankroll's percentage return for each period (e.g., daily, weekly). If you have 30 daily returns, calculate the standard deviation of these 30 percentage values. Financial software, spreadsheets, or dedicated betting analytics platforms can typically calculate this for you from your historical betting data."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can this calculator predict future betting performance?",
      "a": "No, this calculator analyzes historical performance. While a high Sharpe Ratio in the past suggests a robust strategy, it does not guarantee future success. Past performance is not indicative of future results, especially in dynamic environments like sports betting."
    },
    {
      "q": "Should I adjust for transaction costs (e.g., bookmaker's vig) when calculating profit/loss?",
      "a": "Yes, your 'Total Net Profit/Loss' should always be after all costs and fees, including the bookmaker's margin (vig/juice). This ensures your returns are accurately reflected for a realistic assessment of your strategy's true profitability and efficiency."

      "heading": "Why use this Sports Betting Portfolio Risk-Adjusted Return Calculator?",
      "body": "In the exciting and often volatile world of sports betting, tracking simple profit and loss is a fundamental starting point. However, to truly understand the efficacy and efficiency of your betting strategy, you need to go beyond the raw numbers. Inspired by expert predictions for sports matches and the burgeoning interest in betting analytics, this calculator offers a sophisticated financial lens through which to view your betting performance. It's designed for serious bettors, analysts, and anyone looking to elevate their understanding of their sports betting portfolio.\n\nTraditional financial markets extensively use risk-adjusted return metrics to evaluate investment performance. Why should sports betting be any different? A strategy that generates a high return but does so with wild swings in your bankroll might not be as sustainable or desirable as a strategy with slightly lower returns but significantly less volatility. This calculator helps you quantify that trade-off by calculating the Sharpe Ratio, a gold standard in financial performance measurement.\n\nBy leveraging this tool, you can move past anecdotal evidence and gut feelings to make data-driven decisions. You can objectively compare different betting systems, adjust your staking plan, or refine your selection criteria based on how efficiently your strategy generates returns relative to the risk it takes. Ultimately, it empowers users to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of their betting strategy, fostering a more disciplined and potentially more profitable approach to sports betting."

      "heading": "How the calculation works",
      "body": "The core of this calculator revolves around the Sharpe Ratio, a measure that assesses the return of an investment in relation to its risk. The formula for the Sharpe Ratio is typically expressed as: (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Standard Deviation.\n\nLet's break down how the inputs you provide are used to compute this crucial metric:\n\n1.  **Total Return (%):** This is derived directly from your 'Total Net Profit/Loss' and 'Initial Bankroll'. If you started with $10,000 and made $1,500 net profit, your total return is 15%. This gives us the raw performance over the specified data period.\n\n2.  **Annualized Return (%):** Since your data might span days, weeks, or months, we need to annualize the total return to allow for consistent comparison. The calculator takes your total return over the 'Number of Periods' and projects it to an annual figure using the 'Annualization Factor' (e.g., 252 for daily data in a year, 52 for weekly, 12 for monthly). This annualization process compounds the returns, giving a realistic yearly expectation based on your historical performance.\n\n3.  **Annualized Volatility (%):** Risk, in the context of the Sharpe Ratio, is measured by the standard deviation of returns. Your 'Standard Deviation of Periodic Returns' represents the historical fluctuation of your bankroll's percentage returns for each period. To make it comparable with the annualized return, this periodic standard deviation is also annualized by multiplying it by the square root of the 'Annualization Factor'. This provides a standardized measure of the strategy's risk level over a year.\n\n4.  **Annual Risk-Free Rate (%):** This is a baseline return you could expect from a 'risk-free' investment, such as short-term government bonds or a high-yield savings account. It's subtracted from your portfolio's return to determine the 'excess return'—the premium you earn for taking on betting risk.\n\n5.  **Sharpe Ratio Calculation:** Finally, the annualized excess return (Annualized Return - Annual Risk-Free Rate) is divided by the Annualized Volatility. The resulting Sharpe Ratio tells you how much additional return your strategy generated for each unit of risk taken. A higher Sharpe Ratio implies a better risk-adjusted performance."

      "heading": "Common mistakes in Sports Betting Portfolio Risk-Adjusted Return Calculator",
      "body": "While incredibly powerful, using a risk-adjusted return calculator like this one requires careful attention to detail to avoid misleading conclusions. Here are some common mistakes to watch out for:\n\n1.  **Insufficient Data:** Attempting to calculate a Sharpe Ratio with only a handful of bets or a very short historical period will lead to unreliable results. Volatility and true returns only emerge over a significant number of trials and a substantial time frame. Aim for at least several months, if not a year, of consistent betting data.\n\n2.  **Inaccurate Volatility Input:** The 'Standard Deviation of Periodic Returns' is arguably the most critical and often misunderstood input. An incorrect or estimated standard deviation will render the entire Sharpe Ratio meaningless. It must be accurately derived from the actual percentage fluctuations of your bankroll over each period (e.g., daily, weekly). Do not confuse it with strike rate or average odds.\n\n3.  **Ignoring the Risk-Free Rate:** Some users might overlook the importance of the 'Annual Risk-Free Rate'. This isn't just an arbitrary number; it's the opportunity cost of capital. If your betting strategy can't beat a virtually risk-free investment, its efficiency is questionable, regardless of positive raw returns.\n\n4.  **Misinterpreting the Sharpe Ratio:** A high Sharpe Ratio is excellent, but it's essential to compare it within context. Comparing the Sharpe Ratio of a long-term value betting strategy to a high-frequency arbitrage strategy without understanding their inherent differences in risk profiles and operational overhead can be misleading. Always consider the nature of the strategies being compared.\n\n5.  **Incorrect Annualization Factor:** Choosing the wrong 'Annualization Factor' for your 'Number of Periods' will distort both your annualized return and volatility. If your standard deviation is based on daily returns, you must use a daily annualization factor (e.g., 252 trading days). Mismatching these will lead to incorrect annual figures.\n\n6.  **Over-Reliance on Past Performance:** Remember, this calculator is a backward-looking tool. A high Sharpe Ratio from past performance doesn't guarantee future success. Market conditions, betting lines, and your own strategy can change. Use it as a guide for refinement, not a crystal ball.\n\n7.  **Not Accounting for All Costs:** Ensure your 'Total Net Profit/Loss' is truly 'net'. This means deducting all associated costs, including bookmaker commissions, platform fees, and any other expenses related to your betting activity. Overstating profits will artificially inflate your Sharpe Ratio."
