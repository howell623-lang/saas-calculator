    {
      "q": "Why is chocolate bad for dogs?",
      "a": "Chocolate contains a chemical called theobromine. Humans metabolize it easily, but dogs process it very slowly, allowing it to build up to toxic levels in their system."
    },
    {
      "q": "Which chocolate is the worst?",
      "a": "Cocoa powder and baking chocolate are the most dangerous. Milk chocolate is moderate risk. White chocolate has very little theobromine and is rarely toxic (though the sugar/fat can cause pancreatitis)."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the first signs of poisoning?",
      "a": "Symptoms usually appear within 6-12 hours. Look for vomiting, diarrhea, extreme thirst, restlessness, and a racing heart."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can one M&M kill a dog?",
      "a": "For most dogs, no. A 50lb dog would need to eat about 1 lb of M&Ms to be in serious danger. However, a 5lb Chihuahua is at much higher risk from small amounts."

Danger is mostly from sugar/fat.\n*   **Milk Chocolate:** Mild risk (44mg/oz). Requires large amounts to be fatal.\n*   **Dark Chocolate:** High risk (150mg/oz). A small bar can poison a medium-sized dog.\n*   **Baking Chocolate:** Severe risk (390mg/oz). Just two squares can kill a small dog."

Hydrogen peroxide is sometimes used, but it can be dangerous if done incorrectly.\n3.  **Go to the Vet:** If the calculator says 'Moderate' or 'High' risk, go. Time is critical. The vet can use activated charcoal to absorb the toxin."
