    {
      "question": "What makes chocolate toxic to dogs?",
      "answer": "Chocolate contains theobromine, a stimulant similar to caffeine. Dogs metabolize theobromine much slower than humans, allowing it to build up to toxic levels in their system. The darker the chocolate, the higher the theobromine content."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the symptoms of chocolate poisoning?",
      "answer": "Symptoms can vary based on the amount and type of chocolate ingested, and the dog's size. Mild symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, and restlessness. More severe symptoms include hyperactivity, tremors, seizures, elevated heart rate, and in extreme cases, heart failure or death."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly do symptoms appear?",
      "answer": "Symptoms typically appear within 6 to 12 hours of ingestion, but can sometimes take up to 24 hours to manifest. Early intervention is key, so don't wait for symptoms to appear if you suspect your dog has eaten a toxic amount."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I contact a vet?",
      "answer": "Always contact your veterinarian immediately if you suspect your dog has ingested chocolate, even if they are not showing symptoms. This calculator is a tool, but only a vet can provide proper medical advice and treatment."
