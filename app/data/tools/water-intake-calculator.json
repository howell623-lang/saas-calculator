    {
      "question": "Why is daily water intake important?",
      "answer": "Adequate water intake is crucial for numerous bodily functions, including regulating body temperature, lubricating joints, preventing infections, delivering nutrients to cells, and keeping organs functioning properly. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, and impaired physical and cognitive performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much water should I drink daily?",
      "answer": "The recommended daily water intake varies based on factors like weight, activity level, climate, and overall health. A common guideline is to drink around half an ounce to an ounce of water per pound of body weight per day. Our calculator provides a personalized estimate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What counts towards my daily water intake?",
      "answer": "While plain water is the best source, other beverages like milk, juice, herbal tea, and even water-rich foods (fruits and vegetables) contribute to your daily fluid intake. However, sugary drinks and alcoholic beverages can have dehydrating effects and should be consumed in moderation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I drink too much water?",
      "answer": "Yes, excessive water intake, known as hyponatremia, can be dangerous. It can dilute the sodium levels in your blood, leading to serious health issues. This is rare but can occur, especially in endurance athletes or individuals with certain medical conditions. Always listen to your body's signals of thirst."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the signs of dehydration?",
      "answer": "Common signs of dehydration include thirst, dry mouth, infrequent urination, dark-colored urine, fatigue, dizziness, and headaches. Severe dehydration can lead to confusion, low blood pressure, and unconsciousness."
