  "summary": "This tool helps educators, administrators, and platform developers evaluate the accessibility features and overall usability of digital learning environments. By quantifying key accessibility metrics, it provides a comprehensive audit score, highlighting areas for improvement to ensure equitable access for all students, especially critical in times of virtual learning.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "What is a Digital Learning Environment Accessibility Audit?",
      "a": "A Digital Learning Environment (DLE) Accessibility Audit is a systematic evaluation of an online platform, course content, or educational tool to identify barriers that might prevent individuals with disabilities or technical limitations from accessing and interacting with it effectively. It assesses compliance with established accessibility standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and ensures usability for diverse learners."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is accessibility important for online learning?",
      "a": "Accessibility is crucial for online learning to ensure equitable access and opportunities for all students, regardless of their abilities or socio-economic circumstances. It prevents discrimination, enhances learning outcomes for students with diverse needs, expands the reach of educational programs, reduces legal risks related to compliance (e.g., ADA, Section 508), and generally improves the user experience for everyone."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are WCAG guidelines and how do they relate to this calculator?",
      "a": "WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) are internationally recognized guidelines for making web content accessible. They are structured around four core principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR). This calculator incorporates WCAG compliance as a significant input, reflecting its foundational role in assessing digital accessibility. A higher score in this area indicates stronger adherence to these critical standards."
    },
    {
      "q": "How often should an accessibility audit be performed?",
      "a": "Accessibility is not a one-time fix but an ongoing process. Audits should ideally be performed: 1) Before launching a new platform or major course update, 2) Annually for existing platforms and content, 3) After significant changes to the platform's features or content, and 4) In response to user feedback or identified issues. Regular auditing ensures continuous improvement and sustained equitable access."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can this tool help with legal compliance (ADA, Section 508)?",
      "a": "Yes, indirectly. This calculator provides a quantitative score based on common accessibility factors that directly align with legal requirements such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the US and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. By identifying areas of strength and weakness, it can help organizations prioritize efforts to meet or exceed these legal standards, reducing the risk of non-compliance."
    },
    {
      "q": "Who should use this calculator?",
      "a": "This calculator is designed for a broad range of stakeholders in the education sector. This includes K-12 school administrators and educators, university faculty and instructional designers, EdTech product managers and developers, IT departments, accessibility specialists, and anyone responsible for creating or managing digital learning environments."
    },
    {
      "q": "What should I do after receiving my accessibility score?",
      "a": "Your score indicates your current accessibility standing. If your score is low or 'Critical Gaps', prioritize immediate remediation of identified weaknesses. For 'Developing' or 'Good' scores, focus on continuous improvement and proactive measures. Use the breakdown of contributions (e.g., WCAG, Functional Usability) to pinpoint specific areas needing attention. Consider engaging accessibility experts for a deeper, qualitative audit and user testing with individuals with disabilities."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does this tool cover all aspects of accessibility?",
      "a": "While this calculator covers a broad and critical set of quantitative accessibility metrics, it is a diagnostic tool and not exhaustive. True accessibility also involves qualitative factors like user experience testing with diverse individuals with disabilities, comprehensive policy development, ongoing training for staff, and integrating accessibility into the core development lifecycle. It serves as an excellent starting point for a deeper, more holistic accessibility strategy."
