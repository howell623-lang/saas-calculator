      "q": "What is Black-Scholes?",
      "a": "It is a mathematical model used to estimate the theoretical price of European options. Published in 1973, it revolutionized finance by providing a standard way to value derivatives."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is volatility important?",
      "a": "Volatility (Sigma) measures how much the stock price is expected to swing. High volatility increases the price of both Calls and Puts because there is a higher chance the option will end up deeply profitable."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the Risk-Free Rate?",
      "a": "This is the return on an investment with zero risk, typically the yield on U.S. Treasury Bills. It accounts for the 'time value of money'—the idea that cash today is worth more than cash tomorrow."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I use this for American Options?",
      "a": "Strictly speaking, no. Black-Scholes is designed for European options (which can only be exercised at expiration). However, for non-dividend-paying stocks, the price of an American Call is often the same as a European Call."

Their formula provided a rational, scientific way to price risk, eventually earning Scholes and Merton the Nobel Prize in Economics (Black passed away before he could receive it).\n\n**The Core Insight:**\nThe model assumes you can perfectly hedge an option by buying or selling the underlying stock. If you can eliminate risk, the option should earn the risk-free interest rate."

More time = higher price.\n4.  **r (Risk-Free Rate):** Usually the 10-year Treasury yield.\n5.  **σ (Volatility):** The standard deviation of the stock's returns. This is the most sensitive and subjective input."

      "heading": "The Greeks",
      "body": "While this calculator outputs the price, professional traders focus on 'The Greeks'—derivatives of the model that measure sensitivity:\n\n*   **Delta:** How much the option price moves for a $1 move in the stock.\n*   **Theta:** How much value the option loses per day (time decay).\n*   **Vega:** Sensitivity to volatility.\n*   **Rho:** Sensitivity to interest rates."

      "heading": "Limitations",
      "body": "Black-Scholes assumes markets are efficient, volatility is constant, and trading is continuous. None of these are perfectly true in the real world. During market crashes (like 1987 or 2008), volatility spikes in ways the model doesn't predict (known as 'Fat Tails'). Use this price as a theoretical baseline, not a guarantee."
