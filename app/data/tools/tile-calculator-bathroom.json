    {
      "question": "Why do I need to add a wastage percentage?",
      "answer": "Wastage accounts for tiles that need to be cut, may break during installation, or for having spares for future repairs. A typical wastage percentage is 10-15%, but consider more for complex layouts or large tiles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this calculator for both floor and wall tiles?",
      "answer": "Yes, this calculator works for any rectangular area, whether it's a floor or a wall. Just input the correct length and width for the surface you are tiling."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my bathroom is not a perfect rectangle?",
      "answer": "For irregular shapes, divide the area into simpler rectangles, calculate tiles for each section, and sum them up. Or, measure the total square footage of the area directly and use it as your 'room area'."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does this calculator account for grout lines?",
      "answer": "This calculator provides an estimate based on the tile's face area. While grout lines are a small part of the total area, they are generally considered negligible in broad tile count estimates, especially with the inclusion of wastage. For extremely precise counts, a more advanced calculator would be needed."
