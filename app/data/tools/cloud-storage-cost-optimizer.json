      "q": "What is Egress?",
      "a": "Egress is data leaving the cloud. It's often the 'hidden tax' of cloud storage. Moving data IN is usually free; moving data OUT to the internet costs money."

      "q": "What is the difference between Hot, Cool, and Archive?",
      "a": "**Hot:** Fast access, higher storage cost, lower access fees. Best for active websites.\n**Cool:** Slower access (milliseconds), lower storage cost, higher access fees. Best for backups.\n**Archive:** Slowest access (minutes/hours), lowest storage cost, highest retrieval fees. Best for regulatory compliance."

But the bill shock comes from three sources:\n1.  **Volume:** 100 TB is 100,000 GB. That $0.02 adds up to $2,000/month.\n2.  **Egress:** If you serve that data to users, you pay for every byte that leaves the data center.\n3.  **Tier Mismatch:** Storing archival data in a 'Hot' tier is like renting a penthouse apartment for your old cardboard boxes."

Examples: 7-year tax records, legal compliance logs. *Warning: Retrieval can take hours and costs extra.*"
