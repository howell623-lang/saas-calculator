      "q": "What is the Mifflin-St Jeor equation?",
      "a": "It is currently considered the most accurate formula for calculating Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). It was introduced in 1990 and has been validated by numerous studies to be within 10% of actual metabolic rate for most people."

    {
      "q": "Why is 1200 calories the minimum?",
      "a": "It is difficult to get all necessary micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) on less than 1200 calories a day. Eating below this threshold can also trigger 'metabolic adaptation,' where your body slows down to preserve energy, making weight loss harder."
    },
    {
      "q": "Should I eat back my exercise calories?",
      "a": "Generally, no. Fitness trackers often overestimate calorie burn by 20-30%. If you selected an activity level like 'Moderately Active', your exercise is already accounted for in your TDEE. Eating them back would double-count your activity."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is TDEE?",
      "a": "Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is the total number of calories you burn in 24 hours. It combines your BMR (coma calories) + NEAT (fidgeting/walking) + TEF (digestion) + EAT (exercise)."

      "body": "At its molecular level, weight loss is governed by the First Law of Thermodynamics: energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred. Fat is simply stored potential energy. To get rid of it, you must force your body to use it for fuel. This state is called a **Caloric Deficit**.\n\n*   **1 lb of fat** ≈ 3,500 calories.\n*   To lose **1 lb per week**, you need a deficit of 500 calories/day (500 x 7 = 3,500).\n*   To lose **2 lbs per week**, you need a deficit of 1,000 calories/day."

    {
      "heading": "Why 'Eat Less, Move More' fails",
      "body": "While technically true, simplistic advice fails because it ignores **Metabolic Adaptation**. If you cut calories too aggressively (e.g., eating only 800 calories/day), your body perceives this as a famine. It responds by:\n\n1.  Lowering your thyroid hormones (T3/T4).\n2.  Reducing your NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis)—you subconsciously fidget less and sit more.\n3.  Increasing Ghrelin (hunger hormone).\n\nThis tool is designed to find the *sustainable* deficit—enough to burn fat, but not enough to trigger this starvation alarm."

    {
      "heading": "Protein: The Secret Weapon",
      "body": "When you are in a calorie deficit, your body will break down tissue for energy. It prefers to break down fat, but it will also break down muscle. To prevent muscle loss:\n\n1.  **Keep the deficit moderate** (no more than 20-25% below maintenance).\n2.  **Eat high protein** (0.7g - 1g per lb of body weight).\n3.  **Resistance train** (lift weights).\n\nProtein also has a high Thermic Effect of Food (TEF), meaning your body burns more calories digesting protein than carbs or fats."

      "heading": "Setting Realistic Expectations",
      "body": "Weight loss is rarely linear. You might lose 3 lbs one week and 0 lbs the next due to water retention, salt intake, or hormonal cycles. \n\n*   **Safe Rate:** 0.5% to 1% of body weight per week.\n*   **Obese individuals** can lose weight faster safely.\n*   **Lean individuals** must lose weight slower to preserve muscle.\n\nUse the 'Timeframe' input in this calculator to test different scenarios. If the required daily intake turns red or hits the minimum floor, extend your timeline."
