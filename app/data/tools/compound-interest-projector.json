      "q": "What is the 'Rule of 72'?",
      "a": "The Rule of 72 is a mental shortcut to estimate how long it takes to double your money. Divide 72 by your interest rate. For example, at an 8% return, your money doubles every 9 years (72 ÷ 8 = 9)."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does compounding frequency matter?",
      "a": "Yes, but often less than you think. Compounding daily versus monthly on a $10,000 investment at 7% over 10 years only yields a difference of about $20. The most important factors are the interest rate and the time horizon."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is a realistic interest rate?",
      "a": "The S&P 500 has historically returned about 10% annually before inflation (or 7% after inflation). High-yield savings accounts typically offer 3-5%. Crypto or individual stocks vary wildly and carry higher risk."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does inflation affect this?",
      "a": "This calculator shows the 'nominal' future value. If inflation averages 3% per year, $1 million in the future will buy significantly less than $1 million today. To see 'real' purchasing power, subtract 3% from your expected interest rate input."

It is the snowball effect applied to finance. \n\nImagine you invest $100 at 10% interest.\n*   **Year 1:** You earn $10. Total: $110.\n*   **Year 2:** You earn 10% of $110, which is $11. Total: $121.\n*   **Year 3:** You earn 10% of $121, which is $12.10. Total: $133.10.\n\nOver a short period, this seems negligible. But over 30 or 40 years, this exponential curve goes vertical. This is how average income earners become millionaires by retirement."

(Total invested: $24,000)\n*   **Jill** invests $200/month from age 35 to 65. (Total invested: $72,000)\n\nAt a 7% return, **Jack ends up with more money** at age 65, despite investing one-third of what Jill did. This is because his money had 30 more years to compound. The lesson? Start now, even if it's small."

      "body": "1.  **Principal:** Your starting amount. A head start helps, but it's not required.\n2.  **Rate of Return:** The annual percentage growth. Higher risk (stocks) usually yields higher returns (7-10%), while low risk (bonds, CDs) yields lower returns (2-5%).\n3.  **Frequency:** How often interest is calculated. Daily compounding is mathematically superior to annual compounding, but the difference is marginal for most personal investors.\n4.  **Time:** The number of years the money is left alone. This is the exponent in the equation, making it the most sensitive input."

Good for emergency funds, not wealth building."
