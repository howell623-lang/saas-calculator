    {
      "q": "What is Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)?",
      "a": "Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a formula used in inventory management that calculates the optimal number of units a company should add to its inventory with each order to minimize the total cost of inventory, including ordering costs and holding costs."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is EOQ important for inventory management?",
      "a": "EOQ helps businesses minimize inventory-related costs by finding a balance between the cost of placing new orders and the cost of holding inventory. This leads to efficient stock control, reduced waste, prevention of stockouts, and improved cash flow."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the key components of the EOQ formula?",
      "a": "The EOQ formula primarily relies on three variables: Annual Demand (D), which is the total quantity of units required in a year; Order Cost per Order (S), the fixed cost incurred for each order placed; and Annual Holding Cost per Unit (H), the cost of holding one unit in inventory for one year."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does EOQ help reduce costs?",
      "a": "EOQ reduces costs by identifying the order size where the sum of annual ordering costs and annual holding costs is at its minimum. Ordering too little increases ordering frequency and costs, while ordering too much increases storage and capital costs. EOQ finds the optimal point."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can EOQ be used in all types of businesses?",
      "a": "EOQ is widely applicable across various industries that manage physical inventory, from retail and manufacturing to distribution. However, its effectiveness can vary depending on the predictability of demand and the stability of cost factors. Businesses with highly variable demand might need more advanced models."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the limitations of the EOQ model?",
      "a": "The classic EOQ model assumes constant demand, fixed ordering and holding costs, and instant replenishment, which may not always hold true in real-world scenarios. It typically doesn't account for quantity discounts, lead time variability, or safety stock directly, though these can be incorporated into broader inventory strategies."
    },
    {
      "q": "How often should I recalculate my EOQ?",
      "a": "You should recalculate your EOQ whenever there's a significant change in any of the key input variables: annual demand, order cost per order, or annual holding cost per unit. This could be due to market shifts, supplier changes, new product lines, or operational efficiency improvements. Regular review, perhaps quarterly or semi-annually, is good practice."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is a reorder point and how does it relate to EOQ?",
      "a": "The reorder point is the inventory level at which a new order should be placed to avoid stockouts. While EOQ determines *how much* to order, the reorder point determines *when* to order. It typically considers daily demand, lead time, and safety stock. They are complementary concepts for effective inventory management."

      "heading": "Why use this economic-order-quantity?",
      "body": "The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model is a fundamental tool in inventory management, designed to determine the optimal order quantity that minimizes the total cost associated with ordering and holding inventory. Utilizing an EOQ calculator offers significant advantages for businesses of all sizes, from small retailers to large manufacturers. Primarily, it helps achieve a delicate balance between two opposing costs: the cost of placing an order (ordering costs) and the cost of holding inventory (holding costs).\n\nBy precisely calculating the EOQ, businesses can significantly reduce operational expenses. Ordering too frequently, even in small quantities, racks up high ordering costs due to administrative overhead, processing fees, and transportation. Conversely, ordering too much at once leads to excessive holding costs, including warehousing expenses, insurance, obsolescence risk, and capital tied up in stock. The EOQ model pinpoints the sweet spot where these combined costs are at their lowest.\n\nBeyond direct cost savings, an EOQ calculator enhances supply chain efficiency. It provides a data-driven basis for purchasing decisions, moving away from arbitrary or historical ordering patterns. This leads to better stock control, reducing the likelihood of both stockouts (lost sales, customer dissatisfaction) and overstocking (wastes resources, space). Furthermore, by streamlining inventory levels, companies can free up working capital for investment in other critical business areas. In a competitive market, optimizing inventory through EOQ is crucial for building a more resilient, responsive, and profitable business model."

      "heading": "How the calculation works",
      "body": "The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) calculation relies on a straightforward mathematical formula that balances the three primary cost components of inventory management: annual demand, order cost per order, and annual holding cost per unit. The core formula is EOQ = √((2 * D * S) / H), where:\n\n*   **D (Annual Demand)** represents the total number of units a company expects to sell or use in a year. Accurate demand forecasting is crucial, as it directly impacts the calculated optimal quantity. Higher annual demand generally leads to a higher EOQ.\n*   **S (Order Cost per Order)** is the fixed cost incurred each time an order is placed, regardless of quantity. This includes administrative costs like processing purchase orders, inspection, and transportation. Higher order costs encourage larger, less frequent orders to minimize the number of times this cost is incurred.\n*   **H (Annual Holding Cost per Unit)** is the cost of holding one unit of inventory for one year. This encompasses expenses such as warehouse rent, utilities, insurance, depreciation, obsolescence, spoilage, and opportunity cost of capital. Higher holding costs incentivise smaller, more frequent orders.\n\nThe formula identifies the point where decreasing annual ordering cost (as order size increases) intersects with increasing annual holding cost (as order size increases). At this intersection, total inventory cost is minimized. Our calculator not only derives the EOQ but also provides insights into related metrics such as total annual inventory cost (including ordering, holding, and optionally, unit purchase costs), the number of orders per year, and the reorder point. The reorder point, considering daily demand, lead time, and safety stock, ensures new orders are placed in time to prevent stockouts."

      "heading": "Common mistakes in economic-order-quantity",
      "body": "While the Economic Order Quantity model is powerful, its effectiveness hinges on accurate input data and a clear understanding of its assumptions. Several common mistakes can undermine its benefits. One prevalent error is **not regularly updating input variables**. Demand, ordering costs, and holding costs are rarely static; market fluctuations, supplier changes, and operational efficiencies can alter these figures. Using outdated data will lead to sub-optimal ordering decisions.\n\nAnother mistake is **ignoring lead time and safety stock**. The basic EOQ formula tells you *how much* to order, but not *when*. Failing to consider lead time (time between placing an order and receiving it) can lead to stockouts. Neglecting safety stock—extra inventory held to mitigate demand variability—leaves a business vulnerable. While our calculator includes these for a comprehensive approach, relying solely on EOQ without them is a significant oversight.\n\n**Assuming constant demand** is also a critical flaw. The classical EOQ model assumes steady, predictable demand. In reality, demand can be seasonal or subject to trends. Applying a static EOQ in highly variable demand environments can lead to either excessive inventory during low periods or shortages during peak times. Businesses with fluctuating demand might need more advanced inventory models.\n\nFinally, **overlooking quantity discounts and qualitative factors** can lead to missed opportunities or poor strategic choices. Suppliers often offer lower per-unit prices for larger orders, which might make ordering above the calculated EOQ financially advantageous. Qualitative factors, such as supplier reliability, product obsolescence risk, or storage space limitations, should also inform the final ordering decision, as EOQ is a quantitative tool and doesn't inherently account for all nuances."
