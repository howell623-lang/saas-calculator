    {
      "question": "What is a Loan Repayment Calculator?",
      "answer": "A Loan Repayment Calculator is a tool that helps you estimate your monthly loan payments, the total amount you will pay over the loan's lifetime, and the total interest you'll incur. It uses your loan amount, interest rate, and repayment term to provide these figures."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the monthly payment calculated?",
      "answer": "The monthly payment is calculated using a standard amortization formula. It considers the principal loan amount, the annual interest rate (converted to a monthly rate), and the total number of payments you'll make throughout the loan term."
    },
    {
      "question": "What factors affect my loan payment?",
      "answer": "Three main factors influence your loan payment: the principal loan amount (how much you borrow), the annual interest rate (the cost of borrowing), and the loan term (the duration over which you will repay the loan). A higher principal, higher interest rate, or shorter term generally result in higher monthly payments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I pay off my loan early?",
      "answer": "Many loans allow for early repayment, which can significantly reduce the total interest you pay over the life of the loan. However, some loans may have prepayment penalties, so it's essential to check your specific loan agreement or consult with your lender."
