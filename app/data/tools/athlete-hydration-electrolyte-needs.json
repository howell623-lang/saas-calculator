    {
      "q": "Why calculate sweat rate?",
      "a": "Sweat rate varies wildly. One runner might lose 20oz/hour, another 60oz/hour. Drinking generic amounts (like '8 glasses a day') can lead to dangerous dehydration or hyponatremia (over-hydration)."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is Hyponatremia?",
      "a": "It is a condition where sodium levels in the blood become dangerously low, often caused by drinking too much plain water without replacing sodium. Symptoms include nausea, headache, and confusion."
    },
    {
      "q": "How much should I drink to rehydrate?",
      "a": "A general rule is to drink 16-24 oz of fluid for every pound lost during exercise. This ensures you replace the deficit and account for continued urine production."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I know if I'm a 'Salty Sweater'?",
      "a": "If your sweat stings your eyes, tastes very salty, or leaves white chalky stains on your clothes and hat, you are likely a heavy salt loser and need more electrolytes than the average person."

      "body": "Losing just 2% of your body weight in fluid can decrease athletic performance by 10-20%. For a 150lb athlete, that's just 3lbs of sweat—easily lost in an hour of intense summer training. \n\nDehydration thickens the blood, forcing the heart to pump faster (cardiac drift) just to maintain the same pace. It also reduces blood flow to the skin, making you overheat faster."

      "heading": "The Sweat Test Protocol",
      "body": "To get accurate results from this calculator, perform a simple Sweat Test:\n1.  Weigh yourself nude immediately before exercise (empty bladder).\n2.  Exercise for exactly 1 hour at race pace/intensity.\n3.  Do not urinate during the hour.\n4.  Keep track of exactly how much fluid you drink.\n5.  Weigh yourself nude immediately after, towel dried.\n\nInput these numbers to find your unique hourly sweat rate. Repeat this test in different weather conditions (summer vs winter) as heat and humidity drastically change the results."

      "heading": "Electrolytes > Water",
      "body": "Sweat isn't just water; it's a soup of minerals, primarily Sodium. If you only replace the water but not the sodium, you dilute your blood. This is why sports drinks contain salt. For heavy sweaters, salt tablets or high-sodium mixes might be necessary for events longer than 2 hours."
