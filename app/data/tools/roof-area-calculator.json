    {
      "question": "How do I measure my roof pitch?",
      "answer": "To measure roof pitch, use a level to mark a horizontal line 12 inches from a plumb line (or from a rafter edge) on the underside of a rafter. The vertical distance from the 12-inch mark to the underside of the rafter is your 'rise'. For example, if it's 6 inches, you have a 6/12 pitch."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between roof footprint area and total surface area?",
      "answer": "The footprint area is the two-dimensional area of the base of your roof (length \u00d7 width), essentially what you'd see looking directly down. The total surface area is the actual three-dimensional area of the pitched roof planes, accounting for the slope. This is the crucial measurement for estimating materials like shingles, tiles, or metal roofing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can this calculator be used for hip roofs or complex roofs?",
      "answer": "This calculator is designed for simple gable roofs with a single, consistent pitch. For hip roofs, roofs with dormers, multiple pitches, or other complex structures, you will need to break down the roof into simpler geometric shapes and calculate each section's area separately, then sum them up."
    },
    {
      "question": "What units are used for the input and output?",
      "answer": "The inputs for length and width are in feet, and the pitch rise is implicitly in inches (over a 12-inch run). The output areas are provided in square feet (sq ft)."
