    {
      "question": "What type of roofs does this calculator work for?",
      "answer": "This calculator is primarily designed for simple gable roofs (two sloped sides with a ridge). For more complex roof structures like hips, mansards, or multiple gables, you may need to break down the roof into simpler sections and calculate each separately."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does this calculation include overhangs?",
      "answer": "Yes, this calculator includes both eave and gable overhangs in the total surface area calculation, providing a more accurate estimate for material needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I measure roof pitch?",
      "answer": "Roof pitch is expressed as a ratio, typically 'rise over run' (e.g., 6/12). To measure it, place a level horizontally against a rafter or exposed roof decking. Measure 12 inches horizontally along the level, then measure vertically from the 12-inch mark on the level down to the rafter/decking. This vertical measurement is your 'rise'."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is roof area important?",
      "answer": "Knowing your roof's total surface area is crucial for accurately estimating the amount of materials needed (like shingles, tiles, underlayment), planning for solar panel installations, or getting quotes for roof repairs or replacement. It also helps in calculating insulation requirements and storm drainage."
