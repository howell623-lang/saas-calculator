      "q": "What are Fixed Costs?",
      "a": "Fixed costs are expenses that don't change regardless of how much you sell. Examples: Rent, insurance, full-time salaries, software subscriptions, and loan payments."

    {
      "q": "What are Variable Costs?",
      "a": "Variable costs go up with every unit you sell. Examples: Raw materials, packaging, shipping, credit card processing fees, and sales commissions."

    {
      "q": "What is Contribution Margin?",
      "a": "This is the money left over from a sale after paying variable costs (Price - Variable Cost). This 'contributes' to paying down your fixed costs. Once fixed costs are paid, the Contribution Margin becomes pure profit."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is my break-even point so high?",
      "a": "A high break-even point usually means your fixed costs are too high (expensive rent/staff) or your margins are too thin (product price is too close to its cost). You need to either cut overhead or raise prices."

It is the finish line of the 'survival phase' and the starting line of the 'profit phase'.\n\nKnowing this number is non-negotiable. If you need to sell 500 units a month to break even, but your market size only supports 300, you don't have a business—you have a hobby that loses money."

      "body": "If your BEP is too high, you have three levers to pull:\n1.  **Raise Prices:** Increasing the shirt price to $30 raises the margin to $15. Now you only need to sell 67 shirts ($1,000 / $15).\n2.  **Lower Variable Costs:** Switch suppliers to get the shirt cost down to $8. Margin becomes $12. BEP drops to 84 shirts.\n3.  **Cut Fixed Costs:** Move to a cheaper office or cancel unused software. Lowering fixed costs to $800 drops the BEP to 80 shirts."
