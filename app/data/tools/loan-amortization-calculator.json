    {
      "q": "What is loan amortization?",
      "a": "Loan amortization is the process of paying off a debt over time in equal installments. Part of each payment goes toward the loan principal, and part goes toward interest. In the beginning, a larger portion goes to interest, but over time, more of your payment goes toward reducing the principal."
    },
    {
      "q": "How can I reduce the total interest paid?",
      "a": "You can reduce total interest by making a larger down payment, securing a lower interest rate, shortening the loan term (e.g., 15 years instead of 30), or making extra payments toward the principal."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does this calculator account for taxes and insurance?",
      "a": "No, this calculator focuses solely on principal and interest (P&I). For a mortgage, your actual monthly payment (PITI) will likely be higher because it often includes property taxes, homeowners insurance, and possibly private mortgage insurance (PMI)."
    },
    {
      "q": "What happens if I make extra payments?",
      "a": "Making extra payments reduces your principal balance faster, which lowers the amount of interest charged in subsequent months. This can significantly shorten your loan term and save you thousands of dollars in interest."

      "heading": "Understanding Amortization",
      "body": "Amortization sounds complex, but it's simply a schedule of payments. When you take out a fixed-rate loan, your monthly payment stays the same, but the composition of that payment changes every month. In the early years of a 30-year mortgage, for example, the vast majority of your payment is just paying the interest to the bank. Only a tiny fraction chips away at what you actually owe. This is why it takes so long to build equity initially."

      "heading": "The Power of Interest Rates",
      "body": "Your interest rate determines the cost of borrowing money. Even a small difference, like 0.5%, can equate to tens of thousands of dollars over the life of a long-term loan. Use this calculator to compare scenarios: see how much you save by choosing a 15-year term vs. a 30-year term, or how a slightly lower rate impacts your total payout."

    {
      "heading": "Using This Tool for Financial Planning",
      "body": "Before committing to a loan, it's critical to know if the monthly payment fits your budget. Experts often recommend the 28/36 rule: spend no more than 28% of your gross monthly income on housing expenses and no more than 36% on total debt. Use the 'Monthly Payment' output from this tool to check if your potential loan keeps you within these safe limits."
