      "question": "What is BMI?",
      "answer": "BMI stands for Body Mass Index. It is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy. It's calculated for adults aged 20 and over."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is BMI calculated using metric units?",
      "answer": "BMI is calculated by dividing an individual's weight in kilograms (kg) by the square of their height in meters (m\u00b2). For example, if you weigh 70 kg and are 1.75 meters tall (175 cm), your BMI would be 70 / (1.75 * 1.75) = 22.86 kg/m\u00b2."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the common BMI categories for adults?",
      "answer": "Standard BMI categories are: Underweight (below 18.5), Normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), Overweight (25.0 to 29.9), and Obesity (30.0 and above)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is BMI accurate for everyone?",
      "answer": "While BMI is a widely used screening tool, it may not be accurate for certain groups, such as very muscular individuals (who might have a high BMI but low body fat), the elderly, or pregnant women. It should be used as a general guide rather than a definitive diagnosis of health."
