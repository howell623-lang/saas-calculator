  "cta": "Calculate Your Daily Nutrition Targets",
  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "What is TDEE?",
      "a": "TDEE stands for Total Daily Energy Expenditure. It's an estimate of how many calories you burn per day, including your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), the thermic effect of food (TEF), and the energy expended through physical activity (NEAT and exercise)."
    },
    {
      "q": "How accurate is this calculator?",
      "a": "This calculator uses widely accepted formulas like the Mifflin-St Jeor equation for BMR and standard activity multipliers. While it provides a robust estimate, individual metabolic rates can vary. It's a great starting point, but always listen to your body and adjust your intake based on your progress and energy levels."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why are protein, carbs, and fat important?",
      "a": "Each macronutrient plays a vital role. Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth. Carbohydrates are your body's primary energy source. Fats are crucial for hormone production, nutrient absorption, and long-term energy. A balanced intake of all three is key for overall health and specific fitness goals."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are common protein recommendations for active individuals?",
      "a": "For active individuals or those looking to build muscle, protein intake often ranges from 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram (g/kg) of body weight. For weight loss, higher protein intake (up to 2.5-3.0 g/kg) can help preserve muscle mass and increase satiety."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I choose the right 'Activity Level'?",
      "a": "Choose based on your typical weekly routine:\n    - Sedentary: Little to no exercise, desk job.\n    - Lightly Active: Light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week.\n    - Moderately Active: Moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week.\n    - Very Active: Hard exercise/sports 6-7 days/week.\n    - Extra Active: Very hard exercise, physical job, or training twice a day."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I adjust my calorie targets based on my progress?",
      "a": "Absolutely. The results are a starting point. Monitor your weight and body composition weekly. If you're not seeing the desired changes, you might need to slightly adjust your calorie intake (e.g., reduce deficit or increase surplus) by 100-200 calories and re-evaluate after a few weeks."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is there a minimum target calorie output?",
      "a": "For health and safety reasons, the calculator caps the minimum target daily calories at 1200. Consuming fewer than 1200 calories per day can lead to nutrient deficiencies, muscle loss, and other health complications, and should only be done under strict medical supervision."

      "heading": "Why use this Nutrition: TDEE with activity and protein/carbs/fat targets?",
      "body": "Understanding your body's energy needs and how to fuel it correctly is the cornerstone of achieving any health or fitness goal, whether it's shedding stubborn fat, building lean muscle, or simply maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This specialized calculator goes beyond a basic calorie estimate; it provides a comprehensive breakdown of your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) and then meticulously crafts personalized macronutrient targets for protein, carbohydrates, and fats. \n\nMany people embark on fitness journeys with vague ideas about 'eating healthy' or 'cutting calories,' only to find themselves stuck or frustrated. This often happens because they're not precisely meeting their body's unique demands. Your TDEE is influenced by a multitude of factors including your age, gender, height, weight, and crucially, your daily activity level. A sedentary individual has vastly different energy requirements than an athlete training daily. Failing to account for these nuances can lead to under-eating, resulting in fatigue and muscle loss, or over-eating, leading to unwanted fat gain.\n\nFurthermore, while calories are king, the composition of those calories—your macronutrient split—is queen. Protein is vital for muscle repair and satiety, making it indispensable for both muscle gain and fat loss. Carbohydrates provide the immediate energy needed for workouts and daily functions, while healthy fats are essential for hormone production and overall cellular health. This calculator empowers you to move beyond guesswork, offering a data-driven approach to nutrition that considers both your caloric needs and the optimal distribution of macros to support your specific goals. By providing actionable numbers, it allows for greater precision in meal planning, leading to more sustainable results and a deeper understanding of how your body works."

    {
      "heading": "How the calculation works",
      "body": "The calculation process within this tool involves several key steps, building from your basic metabolic rate to your ultimate personalized macro targets. \n\n1.  **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculation:** The first step is to estimate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). This is the number of calories your body burns at rest to perform basic life-sustaining functions like breathing, circulation, and cell production. We utilize the widely respected Mifflin-St Jeor equation, which is considered one of the most accurate BMR formulas:\n    *   For Men: `BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) + 5`\n    *   For Women: `BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age in years) - 161`\n\n2.  **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) Estimation:** Your BMR only accounts for calories burned at rest. To get your TDEE, we factor in your physical activity level. Your BMR is multiplied by an activity factor based on your input:\n    *   Sedentary (little to no exercise): BMR × 1.2\n    *   Lightly Active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week): BMR × 1.375\n    *   Moderately Active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week): BMR × 1.55\n    *   Very Active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days/week): BMR × 1.725\n    *   Extra Active (very hard exercise, physical job, or training twice a day): BMR × 1.9\n\n3.  **Calorie Goal Adjustment:** Once your TDEE is established, we adjust it according to your chosen weight goal. Whether you aim for maintenance, a deficit for weight loss, or a surplus for muscle gain, standard caloric adjustments are applied:\n    *   Maintain: TDEE + 0 calories\n    *   Mild Deficit: TDEE - 250 calories\n    *   Moderate Deficit: TDEE - 500 calories\n    *   Aggressive Deficit: TDEE - 750 calories\n    *   Mild Surplus: TDEE + 250 calories\n    *   Moderate Surplus: TDEE + 500 calories\n    A crucial health safeguard is applied here: your target daily calories will never be set below 1200, to prevent dangerously low caloric intake.\n\n4.  **Macronutrient Calculation:** With your target daily calories in hand, we then break down your intake into protein, carbohydrates, and fats:\n    *   **Protein:** Calculated first based on your desired grams per kilogram of body weight. For example, if you aim for 1.8g/kg and weigh 70kg, you'd target 126g of protein. (1 gram of protein = 4 calories).\n    *   **Fat:** This is then calculated as a percentage of your total target calories. If your target is 2000 calories and you set a 25% fat target, 500 calories would come from fat. (1 gram of fat = 9 calories).\n    *   **Carbohydrates:** The remaining calories are allocated to carbohydrates. This 'fill the rest' approach ensures your total calories are met while prioritizing protein for muscle and fat for essential functions. (1 gram of carbohydrate = 4 calories). If, after allocating protein and fat, the remaining calories for carbs are negative, they are capped at zero, meaning no carbohydrate calories will be allocated."

      "heading": "Common mistakes in Nutrition: TDEE with activity and protein/carbs/fat targets",
      "body": "While this calculator provides an excellent starting point, achieving your nutrition goals requires consistent effort and avoiding common pitfalls. Here are some frequent mistakes people make when applying TDEE and macro targets:\n\n1.  **Underestimating or Overestimating Activity Level:** This is perhaps the most significant source of error. Many individuals overestimate how active they truly are, leading to an inflated TDEE and target calorie intake. Conversely, some underestimate, leading to an overly restrictive diet. Be honest with your activity assessment. A desk job with a few gym sessions per week is likely 'moderately active,' not 'very active.' If in doubt, err on the side of caution or start with a lower activity multiplier and adjust based on results.\n\n2.  **Inconsistent Food Tracking:** Calculating targets is only half the battle; consistently tracking your food intake is crucial to ensure you're actually hitting those targets. Relying on guesswork often leads to under-reporting calorie and macro intake, especially with hidden fats or sugars in seemingly healthy foods. Use a reliable food tracking app and be diligent about measuring portions.\n\n3.  **Ignoring Micronutrients and Food Quality:** Focusing solely on macros can lead to a diet rich in highly processed foods that fit the numbers but lack essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods like lean meats, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. Even with perfect macro splits, a nutrient-poor diet will hinder progress and overall health.\n\n4.  **Expecting Instant Results and Lack of Patience:** The human body doesn't operate on a perfectly linear schedule. Weight loss or gain can fluctuate due to water retention, hormonal changes, and other factors. Don't panic if the scale doesn't move exactly as expected daily or even weekly. Give your chosen targets at least 2-4 weeks of consistent application before making significant adjustments.\n\n5.  **Not Adjusting Targets Over Time:** As you lose or gain weight, your body's energy requirements change. A lighter body needs fewer calories to operate than a heavier one. Similarly, as your fitness improves or your training intensity changes, your activity level might shift. Regularly re-evaluate your TDEE and macro targets (e.g., every 4-6 weeks) and adjust as needed to continue making progress.\n\n6.  **Drastically Cutting Calories or Macros Too Low:** While a deficit is necessary for weight loss, an extreme deficit can lead to muscle loss, metabolic adaptation (slowing down your metabolism), and nutrient deficiencies. Similarly, cutting a macronutrient too low (e.g., extremely low fat for an extended period) can impair hormonal health. The calculator's minimum calorie cap helps prevent this, but it's important to ensure your protein and fat targets remain adequate for health and function."
