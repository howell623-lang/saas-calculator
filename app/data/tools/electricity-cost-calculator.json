    {
      "question": "How is electricity cost calculated?",
      "answer": "The electricity cost is calculated by multiplying the appliance's power consumption (in kilowatts) by the hours it's used, and then by your electricity rate per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The formula is: (Watts / 1000) * Hours Used * Cost per kWh."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where can I find my electricity rate (cost per kWh)?",
      "answer": "Your electricity rate per kWh is typically listed on your monthly electricity bill. It may vary based on your plan, time of use, and location."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is kWh?",
      "answer": "kWh stands for kilowatt-hour, which is a unit of energy equal to 1,000 watt-hours. It represents the energy consumed by a 1,000-watt appliance running for one hour. Electricity companies bill you based on your kWh consumption."
