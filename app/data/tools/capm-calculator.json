      "q": "What is CAPM?",
      "a": "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a formula that describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets, particularly stocks."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is Beta?",
      "a": "Beta measures a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. A beta of 1.0 means the stock moves exactly with the market. A beta of 1.5 means it is 50% more volatile. A beta of 0.5 means it is 50% less volatile."

    {
      "q": "What should I use for the Risk-Free Rate?",
      "a": "Most analysts use the yield on 10-Year U.S. Treasury Bonds as the proxy for the risk-free rate."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is this important?",
      "a": "It helps investors decide if a stock is worth the risk. If a stock's expected return (based on fundamental analysis) is lower than the CAPM 'Required Return', it is theoretically overvalued."

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) answers this question.\n\n**The Formula:**\nRe = Rf + β(Rm – Rf)\n\n*   **Re:** Required Return (Cost of Equity)\n*   **Rf:** Risk-Free Rate (Time value of money)\n*   **β:** Beta (Sensitivity to market risk)\n*   **Rm:** Expected Market Return\n\nThe term `(Rm – Rf)` is the **Market Risk Premium**—the extra reward the market pays for buying stocks instead of safe government bonds."

      "heading": "Beta: The Volatility Multiplier",
      "body": "Beta is the heart of CAPM. It tells you how 'jumpy' a stock is.\n\n*   **Beta = 1.0:** The stock is as risky as the market (e.g., an S&P 500 index fund).\n*   **Beta > 1.0:** Aggressive stocks (e.g., Tech, Biotech). They go up faster in bull markets but crash harder in bear markets.\n*   **Beta < 1.0:** Defensive stocks (e.g., Utilities, Consumer Staples). They are stable and boring.\n*   **Beta < 0:** Inversely correlated (e.g., Gold sometimes). They go up when the market goes down."

      "heading": "Practical Application: WACC",
      "body": "Corporate finance professionals use CAPM to calculate the **Cost of Equity**, which feeds into the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). This hurdle rate determines which projects a company should pursue. If a new factory project is expected to return 8%, but the CAPM calculation says investors demand 10%, the project destroys shareholder value and should be rejected."

    {
      "heading": "Critiques of CAPM",
      "body": "While standard in MBA programs, CAPM is not perfect. It assumes markets are efficient and that Beta is the only measure of risk. In reality, size (small cap vs large cap) and value (growth vs value) also affect returns (Fama-French Three-Factor Model). However, CAPM remains the best starting point for valuation."
