      "q": "What is a realistic tuition inflation rate?",
      "a": "Historically, college tuition has risen about 5% to 8% per year—roughly double the rate of normal inflation. We recommend using at least 5% to be safe."

      "q": "What if I have a funding gap?",
      "a": "Don't panic. You have options: increase monthly contributions, look for scholarships, consider community college for the first 2 years, or plan for student loans to cover the difference."

If a private college costs $60,000 today, and costs rise by 5% annually, a four-year degree for a newborn could cost over **$350,000** in 18 years. \n\nWaiting until high school to start saving is a mathematical disaster. The earlier you start, the more you can rely on compound interest rather than your own paycheck."

Living at home can slash the funding gap in half."
