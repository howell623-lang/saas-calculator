    {
      "question": "How do I measure for paint?",
      "answer": "Measure the length, width, and height of your room. Subtract the areas of any doors and windows that will not be painted. Most paint calculations assume painting walls and ceilings."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does a gallon of paint cover?",
      "answer": "On average, a gallon of paint covers about 350-400 square feet with one coat. However, this can vary based on the paint type, surface porosity, and application method. Always check the manufacturer's recommendations on the paint can."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many coats of paint do I need?",
      "answer": "Most painting projects require two coats for good coverage and durability, especially when changing a color significantly or painting over a darker color. Primer might be needed for very porous surfaces or drastic color changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I buy extra paint?",
      "answer": "It's always a good idea to buy a little extra paint (e.g., 10-15%) for touch-ups later. Make sure to keep the leftover paint in a sealed can in a cool, dry place."
