    {
      "q": "What is the Debt Snowball?",
      "a": "Popularized by Dave Ramsey, the Debt Snowball is a strategy where you list debts from smallest balance to largest. You pay minimums on everything except the smallest, which you attack with every spare dollar. Once paid, you roll that payment into the next smallest, creating a growing 'snowball' of cash flow."
    },
    {
      "q": "Snowball vs. Avalanche: Which is better?",
      "a": "Mathematically, the Avalanche method (paying highest interest rate first) saves more money. However, the Snowball method (paying smallest balance first) is often more successful because the quick wins keep you motivated. Personal finance is 80% behavior, 20% math."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does an extra $50 really matter?",
      "a": "Yes. On a $20,000 debt at 15% interest, adding just $50/month can save you over $1,500 in interest and clear the debt a year earlier. The compound effect of accelerated payments is powerful."
    },
    {
      "q": "Should I use my savings to pay off debt?",
      "a": "Keep a small emergency fund (e.g., $1,000) first. This prevents you from using credit cards again if your car breaks down. Once that safety net is in place, throw remaining savings at the debt."

      "body": "Paying off debt is not just a math problem; if it were, you wouldn't be in debt. It is a behavior problem. The Debt Snowball method works because it modifies behavior. \n\nBy focusing on the smallest balance first, you might pay off a $500 medical bill in month one. That feeling of crossing a line item off your list releases dopamine. It proves to you that **you can do this**. This momentum carries you through the harder, larger debts like student loans or car payments."

    {
      "heading": "How to Execute the Strategy",
      "body": "1.  **List Your Debts:** Ignore interest rates. Rank them from smallest balance to largest.\n2.  **Pay Minimums:** Set up auto-pay for the minimum due on every single debt.\n3.  **Attack:** Throw every extra dollar (tax refunds, side hustle money, the 'Accelerator' amount from this calculator) at the #1 smallest debt.\n4.  **Roll Over:** When debt #1 is gone, take its entire payment (minimum + extra) and add it to the minimum payment of debt #2.\n5.  **Repeat:** By the time you reach your last debt, your monthly payment will be massive."
    },
    {
      "heading": "The 'Accelerator' Effect",
      "body": "This calculator demonstrates a crucial principle: **Intervention**. If you just pay the minimums, you are on the bank's plan, which is designed to keep you in debt for decades. \n\nBy adding an 'Accelerator' payment—even just cutting cable or dining out less to find $100/month—you are intervening in the math. You are reducing the principal faster than the interest can accumulate. As shown in your results, this small sacrifice often results in saving *years* of payments."

    {
      "heading": "Snowball vs. Avalanche Comparison",
      "body": "**Debt Snowball (Smallest Balance First):**\n*   **Best For:** Motivation, quick wins, behavioral change.\n*   **Cost:** Slightly higher total interest paid.\n\n**Debt Avalanche (Highest Interest First):**\n*   **Best For:** Maximizing mathematical efficiency.\n*   **Cost:** Requires discipline; you might go years without seeing a debt completely disappear.\n\n**Verdict:** The best method is the one you stick to. For most people, that is the Snowball."
