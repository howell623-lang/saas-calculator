      "q": "How does this calculate 'Equivalent Salary'?",
      "a": "It calculates the difference in major expenses (Housing, Food, Utilities) and adds that difference to your current salary, grossed up for taxes. It answers: 'How much do I need to earn to have the same lifestyle?'"
    },

      "q": "Where do I find the 'Price Difference' percentages?",
      "a": "You can find city comparison data on sites like Numbeo or NerdWallet. For example, if Numbeo says groceries in NYC are 20% higher than in Austin, enter '20' in the Groceries field."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does this include state taxes?",
      "a": "This tool uses a simplified tax estimate. Moving from a no-tax state (like TX or FL) to a high-tax state (like CA or NY) will have a *massive* impact not fully captured here. You should add an extra 5-10% buffer to the 'Required Salary' if moving to a high-tax jurisdiction."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is housing the biggest factor?",
      "a": "For most people, rent or mortgage is the single largest monthly expense. A 50% increase in rent often outweighs a 20% increase in food prices. Always secure a housing estimate before accepting a job offer."

If you move from Des Moines to San Francisco for a $50,000 raise, you might actually be taking a pay cut.\n\n**The Purchasing Power Parity:**\n$100,000 in a low-cost city might feel like $250,000 in a high-cost city. Your quality of life depends on your 'disposable income'—what's left after the bills are paid—not the number on your offer letter."

Do not rely on outdated averages.\n2.  **Taxes:** State income tax ranges from 0% (WA, TX, FL) to over 13% (CA). This comes directly out of your paycheck.\n3.  **Commute:** A 'cheaper' house 1 hour away costs you 10 hours a week (unpaid time) plus gas and wear-and-tear."
